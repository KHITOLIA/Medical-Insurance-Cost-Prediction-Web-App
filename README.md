# 💰 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction & EDA

## **Project Overview**

This project predicts **medical insurance costs** based on personal and lifestyle information using a trained machine learning model.
It also provides an **interactive EDA dashboard** to explore insights from the dataset.

**Features:**

* Predict insurance cost based on Age, BMI, Children, Gender, Smoker status, and Region.
* Interactive **EDA dashboard** with charts for Age, BMI, Smoker analysis, Region, and Charges distribution.
* Modern **Streamlit interface** with sliders, select boxes, and theme toggle.
* Dataset summary and statistics cards.
* Gradient Boosting Regressor model for better predictions (R² ≈ 0.8–0.85).

## **📋 Dataset**

* Dataset: `insurance.csv`
* Columns:

  * `age` → Age of the insured person
  * `sex` → Gender (`male`/`female`)
  * `bmi` → Body Mass Index
  * `children` → Number of children/dependents
  * `smoker` → Smoking status (`yes`/`no`)
  * `region` → Geographic region (`northeast`, `northwest`, `southeast`, `southwest`)
  * `charges` → Annual insurance charges (target variable)

## **💻 Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-predictor.git
cd insurance-predictor
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. **Install required packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`requirements.txt` example:**

```
streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
```

---

## **⚡ Running the App**

Start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser at:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

## **🧮 How It Works**

### **Prediction**

* Users input Age, BMI, Number of Children, Gender, Smoker status, and Region.
* The app encodes categorical variables and uses a **trained Gradient Boosting Regressor** to predict insurance cost.
* Prediction is shown instantly with a visually appealing display.

### **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**

* Users can select different sections from a sidebar **selectbox**.
* Sections include:

  * Dataset Overview
  * Age & BMI Distribution
  * Smoker Analysis
  * Region Analysis
  * Charges Distribution
* Interactive charts are plotted using **Seaborn + Matplotlib**.
* Dataset statistics are displayed via **cards and tables**.

---

## **🛠 Model Details**

* Model: **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
* Features: Age, BMI, Children, Smoker, Sex (one-hot), Region (one-hot), Interaction features (age*bmi, bmi*smoker)
* Performance: R² ~ 0.8–0.85 on the test set

**Optional Improvements:**

* Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`
* Handle outliers for high charges
* Add more features (income, pre-existing conditions, lifestyle info)

---

## **🎨 UI Features**

* Sliders for numeric inputs
* Selectboxes for categorical inputs
* Dark/Light theme toggle
* Prediction output card with animated display
* Mini inline charts on home page
* “Explore Data” button navigates to full EDA dashboard

## **📈 Screenshots**

* **Home Page** – Prediction & dataset insights
* **EDA Dashboard** – Interactive charts for Age, BMI, Smoker, Region, and Charges

*(Include screenshots of your Streamlit app here)*

---

## **🚀 Future Enhancements**

* Add **real-time filter sliders** for EDA charts (e.g., filter by age/BMI range)
* Add **downloadable prediction report** as CSV or PDF
* Deploy the app on **Streamlit Cloud** or **Heroku**
* Add **multi-model comparison** (Linear Regression vs Random Forest vs Gradient Boosting)
* Use **Plotly for fully interactive charts** if desired

---

## **💡 Notes**

* R² ~0.74–0.85 is considered **good for real-world medical insurance prediction**.
* Streamlit allows **instant interactive feedback**, making it ideal for demo apps.
* Ensure `model.pkl` matches the feature engineering used in `app.py`.

If you want, I can **also create a ready-to-use `requirements.txt` and sample `model.pkl` script** so anyone can just download and run your app instantly.

Do you want me to do that next?
